            We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2010 with the goal
            of breaking all barriers that traders and investors face in India in
            terms of cost, support, and technology. We named the company
            Zerodha, a combination of Zero and "Rodha", the Sanskrit word for
            barrier.
